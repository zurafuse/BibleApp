    <description>In 1604, King James I of England authorized that a new translation of the Bible into English be started. It was finished in 1611, just 85 years after the first translation of the New Testament into English appeared (Tyndale, 1526). The Authorized Version, or King James Version, quickly became the standard for English-speaking Protestants. Its flowing language and prose rhythm has had a profound influence on the literature of the past 300 years.</description>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1" trans="true">In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2" trans="true">And it was, that the earth was formless and empty; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was fluttering upon the face of the waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3" trans="true">And God said, Let light exist. And light came into existence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4" trans="true">And God saw the light, that it was good. And God separated the light from the darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning - day one.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6" trans="true">And God said, Let an expanse exist in the midst of the waters, and let it exist to divide between waters and waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And God made the expanse, and He split the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning - day two.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And there was evening and there was morning - day three.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And God said, Let there be lights in the expanse of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And let them be for lights in the expanse of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And God set them in the expanse of the heaven to give light upon the earth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And there was evening and there was morning - day four.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that have life, and birds that may fly above the earth in the open expanse of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And God created giant sea creatures, and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And there was evening and there was morning - day five.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning - day six.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Yahweh God made the earth and the heavens,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Yahweh God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Yahweh God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And out of the ground made Yahweh God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Yahweh God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it: for in the day that you eat thereof thou shalt surely die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Yahweh God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And out of the ground Yahweh God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the rib, which Yahweh God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which Yahweh God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, has God said, you shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, you shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the serpent said unto the woman, you shall not surely die:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they heard the voice of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God amongst the trees of the garden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Yahweh God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Yahweh God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Yahweh God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, you shall not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Unto Adam also and to his wife did Yahweh God make coats of skins, and clothed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Yahweh God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore Yahweh God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Yahweh had respect unto Abel and to his offering:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Yahweh said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Yahweh said unto Cain, Where is Abel your brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of your brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive your brother's blood from thy hand;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Cain said unto Yahweh, My punishment is greater than I can bear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Yahweh said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Yahweh set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Cain went out from the presence of Yahweh, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of Yahweh.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of Yahweh's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the children of Israel went away, and did as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And it came to pass, that at midnight Yahweh smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve Yahweh, as ye have said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="37">And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of Yahweh went out from the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">It is a night to be much observed unto Yahweh for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of Yahweh to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And Yahweh said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="45">A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And Moses went and spoke these words unto all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also Yahweh hath said unto me, you shall not go over this Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Yahweh thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them: and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as Yahweh hath said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Yahweh shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Yahweh shall give them up before your face, that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for Yahweh your God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people unto the land which Yahweh hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Yahweh, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and unto all the elders of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When all Israel is come to appear before Yahweh your God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Yahweh your God, and observe to do all the words of this law:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear Yahweh your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Yahweh said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Yahweh appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Yahweh said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God is not among us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against Yahweh; and how much more after my death?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Moses spoke in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Because I will publish the name of Yahweh: ascribe ye greatness unto our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Do ye thus requite Yahweh, O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When ELYON divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For Yahweh's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Yahweh alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when Yahweh saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and Yahweh hath not done all this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and Yahweh had shut them up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">To me belongeth vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For Yahweh shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And Yahweh spoke unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron your brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but you shall not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, Yahweh, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;</VERS>
