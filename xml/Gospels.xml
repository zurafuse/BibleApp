    <description>In 1604, King James I of England authorized that a new translation of the Bible into English be started. It was finished in 1611, just 85 years after the first translation of the New Testament into English appeared (Tyndale, 1526). The Authorized Version, or King James Version, quickly became the standard for English-speaking Protestants. Its flowing language and prose rhythm has had a profound influence on the literature of the past 300 years.</description>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The book of the generation of Yeshua the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Judah begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Yeshua, who is called Messiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Messiah are fourteen generations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now the birth of Yeshua the Messiah was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Yeshua: for he shall save his people from their sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name Yeshua.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when Yeshua was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Messiah should be born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and with fire:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then cometh Yeshua from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Yeshua answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Yeshua, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then was Yeshua led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Yeshua said unto him, It is written again, you shall not tempt the Lord thy God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then saith Yeshua unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now when Yeshua had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">From that time Yeshua began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Yeshua, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Yeshua went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, you shall not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, you shall not commit adultery:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, you shall not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when thou prayest, you shall not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Give us this day our daily bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="29">But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">All these things spake Yeshua unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="36">Then Yeshua sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Yeshua said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Yeshua came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elijah; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Messiah, the Son of the living God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Yeshua the Messiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">From that time forth began Yeshua to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then said Yeshua unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And Yeshua answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For many are called, but few are chosen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But Yeshua perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">And last of all the woman died also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Yeshua answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Master, which is the great commandment in the law?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Yeshua said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">This is the first and great commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">While the Pharisees were gathered together, Yeshua asked them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Saying, What think ye of Messiah? whose son is he? They say unto him, The Son of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then spake Yeshua to the multitude, and to his disciples,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, when Yeshua had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And consulted that they might take Yeshua by subtilty, and kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now when Yeshua was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When Yeshua understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this good news shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Yeshua, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the disciples did as Yeshua had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And as they were eating, Yeshua took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then saith Yeshua unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Yeshua said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Then cometh Yeshua with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And forthwith he came to Yeshua, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And Yeshua said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Yeshua, and took him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And, behold, one of them which were with Yeshua stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then said Yeshua unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">In that same hour said Yeshua to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And they that had laid hold on Yeshua led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Yeshua, to put him to death;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="62">And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">But Yeshua held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Messiah, the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Yeshua saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="66">What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="67">Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="68">Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Messiah, Who is he that smote thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="69">Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Yeshua of Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="70">But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what you say.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="71">And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Yeshua of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="72">And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="73">And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="74">Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Yeshua to put him to death:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Yeshua stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Yeshua said unto him, you have said it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they had then a notable prisoner, called Joshua Barabbas.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Yeshua which is called Messiah?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Yeshua.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Yeshua, he delivered him to be crucified.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the soldiers of the governor took Yeshua into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="35">And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And sitting down they watched him there;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS Yeshua THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And about the ninth hour Yeshua cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Yeshua, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="57">When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Yeshua' disciple:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="61">And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="63">Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="64">Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="65">Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now after that John was put in prison, Yeshua came into Galilee, preaching the glad tidings of God's Kingdom,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the good news.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Yeshua said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Yeshua of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Yeshua rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And all the city was gathered together at the door.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And Yeshua, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Yeshua could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">When Yeshua saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And immediately when Yeshua perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But Yeshua said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they went out, and preached that men should repent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Others said, That it is Elijah. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Yeshua, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And Yeshua, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And they did all eat, and were filled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He answered and said unto them, Well hath Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curses his father or mother shall surely be put to death:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Yeshua said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Yeshua called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when Yeshua knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And Yeshua went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they answered, John the Baptist: but some say, Elijah; and others, One of the prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Messiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and because of the Good News, the same shall save it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And after six days Yeshua taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And there appeared unto them Elijah with Moses: and they were talking with Yeshua.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Peter answered and said to Yeshua, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Yeshua only with themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elijah must first come?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he answered and told them, Elijah verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But I say unto you, That Elijah is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Yeshua said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">When Yeshua saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But Yeshua took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Yeshua answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when Yeshua saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Yeshua said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then Yeshua beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Yeshua looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Yeshua answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And Yeshua looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Yeshua answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and because of the Good News,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Yeshua went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">But Yeshua said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And they said unto him, We can. And Yeshua said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">But Yeshua called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And when he heard that it was Yeshua of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Yeshua, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And Yeshua stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Yeshua.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And Yeshua answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And Yeshua said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Yeshua in the way.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they said unto them even as Yeshua had commanded: and they let them go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they brought the colt to Yeshua, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Yeshua entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Yeshua answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they come to Jerusalem: and Yeshua went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when even was come, he went out of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Yeshua answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Yeshua answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And they answered and said unto Yeshua, We cannot tell. And Yeshua answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Yeshua answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Yeshua answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Yeshua answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And when Yeshua saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And Yeshua answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Messiah is the Son of David?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For David himself said by the Holy Spirit, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And Yeshua sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Yeshua answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Yeshua answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Messiah; and shall deceive many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the Glad Tidings must first be published among all nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Messiah; or, lo, he is there; believe him not:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For false messiahs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Yeshua said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this good news shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that you may eat the passover?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">(Please note that some ancient manuscripts do not contain the rest of this book.) Now when Yeshua was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his course,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Yeshua.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And of some, that Elijah had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they did so, and made them all sit down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elijah; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, God's Messiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elijah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Yeshua, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And when the voice was past, Yeshua was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And Yeshua answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Yeshua rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Yeshua did, he said unto his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And Yeshua, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And Yeshua said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elijah did?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">And Yeshua said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="60">Yeshua said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="61">And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="62">And Yeshua said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they lifted up their voices, and said, Yeshua, Master, have mercy on us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Yeshua answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Yeshua called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Yeshua said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now when Yeshua heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when Yeshua saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="40">And Yeshua stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And Yeshua said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Yeshua entered and passed through Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he sought to see Yeshua who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when Yeshua came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Yeshua said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And they said, The Lord hath need of him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they brought him to Yeshua: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Yeshua thereon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="45">And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the good news, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Yeshua said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that you say and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Last of all the woman died also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And Yeshua answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And he said unto them, How say they that Messiah is David's son?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Messiah; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, you say it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when Herod saw Yeshua, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="41">And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And he said unto Yeshua, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And Yeshua said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="52">This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Yeshua.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Yeshua.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">And they remembered his words,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Yeshua himself drew near, and went with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Yeshua of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Should not Messiah have suffered these things, and enter into his glory?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And as they thus spake, Yeshua himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And he took it, and did eat before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for Messiah to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="49">And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1" trans="true">In the beginning was the Word. And the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2" trans="true">This One was with God in the beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3" trans="true">Everything was made by him. And nothing that came into existence was made without him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4" trans="true">In him was Life; and the Life was the Light of mankind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5" trans="true">And the Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not grasp it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He came to his own people, and his own people did not receive him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For the Torah was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Yeshua the Messiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Messiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Messiah, nor Elijah, neither that prophet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The next day John seeth Yeshua coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And looking upon Yeshua as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Yeshua.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then Yeshua turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messiah! (Which is, being interpreted, the Christ - the anointed one.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And he brought him to Yeshua. And when Yeshua beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">The day following Yeshua would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Yeshua of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">Yeshua saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Yeshua answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Yeshua answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Yeshua was there:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And both Yeshua was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when they wanted wine, the mother of Yeshua saith unto him, They have no wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Yeshua saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Yeshua saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">This beginning of miracles did Yeshua in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Yeshua went up to Jerusalem,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Yeshua answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he spake of the temple of his body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Yeshua had said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But Yeshua did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The same came to Yeshua by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Yeshua answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Yeshua answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Yeshua answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">After these things came Yeshua and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For John was not yet cast into prison.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Messiah, but that I am sent before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">He must increase, but I must decrease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Yeshua made and baptized more disciples than John,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Though Yeshua himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he must needs go through Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now Jacob's well was there. Yeshua therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Yeshua saith unto her, Give me to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Yeshua answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Yeshua answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Yeshua saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Yeshua said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Yeshua saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The woman said to him, I know that Messiah is coming, who is called Christ (the anointed one): when he has come, he will tell us all things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Yeshua said to her, I who speaks unto you, am He.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Messiah?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Yeshua saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And many more believed because of his own word;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Messiah, the Saviour of the world.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">For Yeshua himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">So Yeshua came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">When he heard that Yeshua was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Then said Yeshua unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">Yeshua saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Yeshua had spoken unto him, and he went his way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Yeshua said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">This is again the second miracle that Yeshua did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Yeshua went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When Yeshua saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Yeshua saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Yeshua had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Afterward Yeshua findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Yeshua, which had made him whole.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And therefore did the Jews persecute Yeshua, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But Yeshua answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then answered Yeshua and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="40">But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">Yeshua said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="48">Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Yeshua answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="52">Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and you say, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="53">Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="54">Yeshua answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="55">Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="56">Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="57">Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="58">Yeshua said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="59">Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Yeshua hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And as Yeshua passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Yeshua answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He answered and said, A man that is called Yeshua made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="36">He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And Yeshua said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And Yeshua said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Yeshua therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They answered him, Yeshua of Nazareth. Yeshua saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Yeshua of Nazareth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Yeshua answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then said Yeshua unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Yeshua, and bound him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Simon Peter followed Yeshua, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Yeshua into the palace of the high priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The high priest then asked Yeshua of his disciples, and of his doctrine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Yeshua answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Yeshua with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Yeshua answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then led they Yeshua from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">That the saying of Yeshua might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Yeshua, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Yeshua answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Yeshua answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Yeshua answered, you say that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Pilate therefore took Yeshua, and scourged him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then came Yeshua forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Yeshua, Whence art thou? But Yeshua gave him no answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Yeshua answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Yeshua forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Yeshua, and led him away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Yeshua in the midst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, Yeshua OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Yeshua was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Yeshua, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now there stood by the cross of Yeshua his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When Yeshua therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">After this, Yeshua knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">When Yeshua therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But when they came to Yeshua, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Yeshua, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Yeshua: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Yeshua.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Yeshua by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Then took they the body of Yeshua, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">There laid they Yeshua therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Yeshua loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Yeshua had lain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Yeshua standing, and knew not that it was Yeshua.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Yeshua saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Yeshua saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Yeshua saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Yeshua and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then said Yeshua to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Yeshua came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Yeshua, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Yeshua saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And many other signs truly did Yeshua in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But these are written, that ye might believe that Yeshua is the Messiah, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things Yeshua shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when the morning was now come, Yeshua stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Yeshua.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Yeshua saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore that disciple whom Yeshua loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Yeshua saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Yeshua saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Yeshua then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">This is now the third time that Yeshua shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So when they had dined, Yeshua saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Yeshua saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Yeshua loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Peter seeing him saith to Yeshua, Lord, and what shall this man do?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Yeshua saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Yeshua said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And there are also many other things which Yeshua did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.</VERS>
