    <description>In 1604, King James I of England authorized that a new translation of the Bible into English be started. It was finished in 1611, just 85 years after the first translation of the New Testament into English appeared (Tyndale, 1526). The Authorized Version, or King James Version, quickly became the standard for English-speaking Protestants. Its flowing language and prose rhythm has had a profound influence on the literature of the past 300 years.</description>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Only be thou strong and very courageous, that you may observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper whithersoever thou goest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for Yahweh your God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD'S servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only Yahweh your God be with thee, as he was with Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father's house, and give me a true token:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until every thing was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his banks, as they did before.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the captain of the LORD'S host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, you shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all the country.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east side of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto Yahweh your God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD'S anointed is before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he said unto him, God forbid; you shall not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that you may go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And you shall not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But also you shall not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, you shall not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="25">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with Yahweh your God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="26">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD'S anointed, and be guiltless?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD'S anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD'S anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness: for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD'S anointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="33">Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltless.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the king said, Whosoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak thou.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.</VERS>

And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But the people answered, you shall not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="28">And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be Yahweh your God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So Solomon built the house, and finished it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the cieling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all molten.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright brass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.</VERS>
