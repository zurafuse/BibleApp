    <description>In 1604, King James I of England authorized that a new translation of the Bible into English be started. It was finished in 1611, just 85 years after the first translation of the New Testament into English appeared (Tyndale, 1526). The Authorized Version, or King James Version, quickly became the standard for English-speaking Protestants. Its flowing language and prose rhythm has had a profound influence on the literature of the past 300 years.</description>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">My son, hear the instruction of your father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of Yahweh:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then shalt thou understand the fear of Yahweh, and find the knowledge of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For Yahweh giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">That you may walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Trust in Yahweh with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear Yahweh, and depart from evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Honour Yahweh with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">My son, despise not the chastening of Yahweh; neither be weary of his correction:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For whom Yahweh loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Yahweh by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">When thou liest down, you shall not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For Yahweh shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For the froward is abomination to Yahweh: but his secret is with the righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">The curse of Yahweh is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, you shall not stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.</VERS>

    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">That you may regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the ways of man are before the eyes of Yahweh, and he pondereth all his goings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">These six things doth Yahweh hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.</VERS>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="18" bname="Job" bsname="Job">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Yahweh, and Satan came also among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Yahweh said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Yahweh said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Yahweh said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: Yahweh gave, and Yahweh hath taken away; blessed be the name of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Yahweh, and Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Yahweh said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered Yahweh, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Yahweh said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Satan answered Yahweh, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Yahweh said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So went Satan forth from the presence of Yahweh, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Job spake, and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="21">Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that Yahweh had visited his people in giving them bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: Yahweh deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Yahweh grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of Yahweh is gone out against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: Yahweh do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for SHADDAI has dealt very bitterly with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I went out full, and Yahweh hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing Yahweh hath testified against me, and SHADDAI has afflicted me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, Yahweh be with you. And they answered him, Yahweh bless thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left your father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Yahweh recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of Yahweh God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of Yahweh, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And she said unto her, All that you say unto me I will do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, Blessed be thou of Yahweh, my daughter: for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as Yahweh liveth: lie down until the morning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew off his shoe.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. Yahweh make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which Yahweh shall give thee of this young woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, Yahweh gave her conception, and she bare a son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be Yahweh, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for Yahweh hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.</VERS>

    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits, and the width thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of your father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar your father, the king, I say, your father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of Adam: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with thee: be of good courage, and do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they sware.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now therefore make confession unto Yahweh God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And said, I beseech thee, Oh Yahweh God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that you may hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that you may be their king, according to these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as you say, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found written therein,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;</VERS>

    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Yahweh had commanded to Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he read therein before the street that was before the water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Ezra blessed Yahweh, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped Yahweh with their faces to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in their place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto Yahweh your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of Yahweh is your strength.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they found written in the law which Yahweh had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of Yahweh their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped Yahweh their God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto Yahweh their God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless Yahweh your God for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Thou, you alone, are Yahweh; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">You are Yahweh, the God who did choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, you shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of Yahweh, and to record, and to thank and praise Yahweh God of Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank Yahweh into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Give thanks unto Yahweh, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Seek Yahweh and his strength, seek his face continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He is Yahweh our God; his judgments are in all the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he commanded to a thousand generations;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Sing unto Yahweh, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For all the gods of the people are idols: but Yahweh made the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Give unto Yahweh, ye kindreds of the people, give unto Yahweh glory and strength.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Give unto Yahweh the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship Yahweh in the beauty of holiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, Yahweh reigneth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of Yahweh, because he cometh to judge the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">O give thanks unto Yahweh; for he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Blessed be Yahweh God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">So he left there before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And Obededom with their brethren, sixty-eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of Yahweh in the high place that was at Gibeon,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">To offer burnt offerings unto Yahweh upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law of Yahweh, which he commanded Israel;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to Yahweh, because his mercy endureth for ever;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of Yahweh remaineth under curtains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God is with thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith Yahweh, you shall not build me an house to dwell in:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus says Yahweh of Armies, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that Yahweh will build thee an house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with your fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And David the king came and sat before Yahweh, and said, Who am I, Oh Yahweh God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, Oh Yahweh God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Oh Yahweh, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Oh Yahweh, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, Yahweh, becamest their God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Therefore now, Yahweh, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, Yahweh of Armies is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And now, Yahweh, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, Oh Yahweh, and it shall be blessed for ever.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus Yahweh preserved David whithersoever he went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Them also king David dedicated unto Yahweh, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus Yahweh preserved David whithersoever he went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour your father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let Yahweh do that which is good in his sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot: and he also was the son of the giant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Joab answered, Yahweh make his people an hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred seventy thousand men that drew sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Yahweh spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith Yahweh, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith Yahweh, Choose thee</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of Yahweh, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of Yahweh destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of Yahweh; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So Yahweh sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, Yahweh beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of Yahweh stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Yahweh stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, Oh Yahweh my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto Yahweh in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto Yahweh: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for Yahweh, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And David built there an altar unto Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon Yahweh; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And Yahweh commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">At that time when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">For the tabernacle of Yahweh, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Yahweh.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then David said, This is the house of Yahweh God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for Yahweh must be exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for Yahweh God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of Yahweh my God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But the word of Yahweh came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: you shall not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now, my son, Yahweh be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of Yahweh your God, as he hath said of thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Only Yahweh give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that you may keep the law of Yahweh your God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which Yahweh charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of Yahweh an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and you may add thereto.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and Yahweh be with thee.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And commanded Judah to seek Yahweh God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because Yahweh had given him rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought Yahweh our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and eighty thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And Asa cried unto Yahweh his God, and said, Yahweh, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, Oh Yahweh our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. Oh Yahweh, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Yahweh smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Yahweh, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of Yahweh came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of Yahweh, that was before the porch of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that Yahweh his God was with him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and your father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on Yahweh your God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on Yahweh, he delivered them into thine hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For the eyes of Yahweh run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of Yahweh: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to Yahweh God of their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept other seven days with gladness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is Yahweh our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, Yahweh our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And his servants spake yet more against Yahweh God, and against his servant Hezekiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He wrote also letters to rail on Yahweh God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Yahweh sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Thus Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all other, and guided them on every side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And many brought gifts unto Yahweh to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto Yahweh: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Yahweh came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="33">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, like unto the abominations of the heathen, whom Yahweh had cast out before the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Also he built altars in the house of Yahweh, whereof Yahweh had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and to do worse than the heathen, whom Yahweh had destroyed before the children of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Yahweh spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Wherefore Yahweh brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when he was in affliction, he besought Yahweh his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Yahweh he was God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of Yahweh, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of Yahweh, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he repaired the altar of Yahweh, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve Yahweh God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto Yahweh their God only.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of Yahweh God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And humbled not himself before Yahweh, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="34">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he did that which was right in the sight of Yahweh, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of Yahweh his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of Yahweh, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of Yahweh, to repair and amend the house:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of Yahweh given by Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of Yahweh. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of Yahweh, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Go, enquire of Yahweh for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great is the wrath of Yahweh that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Yahweh, to do after all that is written in this book.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that effect.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And she answered them, Thus saith Yahweh God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Thus saith Yahweh, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of Yahweh, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith Yahweh God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Behold, I will gather thee to your fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the king went up into the house of Yahweh, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of Yahweh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve Yahweh their God. And all his days they departed not from following Yahweh, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="35">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto Yahweh in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of Yahweh,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto Yahweh, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now Yahweh your God, and his people Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the division of the families of the Levites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that they may do according to the word of Yahweh by the hand of Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king's substance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto Yahweh, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So all the service of Yahweh was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of Yahweh, according to the commandment of king Josiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to that which was written in the law of Yahweh,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of Yahweh to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.</VERS>
